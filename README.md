# React Calculator

A simple calculator application built with React. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and handles various edge cases, including decimals and sequential operations. This project is a functional calculator that adheres to the user stories provided by the [FreeCodeCamp Calculator Project](https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/).

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handle decimal numbers and ensure proper arithmetic precision.
- Correctly manage multiple operators and operator precedence.
- Clear the input and output values with a dedicated clear button.
- Display the current formula and the result dynamically.

## User Stories

1. The calculator contains a clickable `=` button with an `id="equals"`.
2. The calculator contains clickable elements for numbers `0` through `9`, each with a corresponding ID (`id="zero"`, `id="one"`, etc.).
3. The calculator contains clickable elements for the four primary mathematical operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, each with corresponding IDs (`id="add"`, `id="subtract"`, `id="multiply"`, `id="divide"`).
4. The calculator contains a clickable decimal point button with an `id="decimal"`.
5. The calculator contains a clickable clear button with an `id="clear"`.
6. The calculator contains a display element with an `id="display"`.
7. Pressing the clear button resets the calculator to its initialized state.
8. The calculator updates the display as numbers are input.
9. Supports chaining of numbers and operators, with correct results displayed when `=` is pressed.
10. Prevents multiple leading zeros in numbers.
11. Manages decimal points correctly, allowing only one per number.
12. Handles operations with decimal numbers accurately.
13. Evaluates sequential operators correctly, using the last entered operator.
14. Starts a new calculation with the result after pressing `=` followed by an operator.
15. Provides precision for decimal calculations to at least 4 decimal places.

## Usage
- Click on the numbers and operators to build an arithmetic expression.
- Press the = button to calculate and display the result.
- Use the AC button to clear the current calculation and start over.
- The calculator supports both integer and decimal inputs.
